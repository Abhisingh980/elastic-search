## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to manage environment-specific variables:

```env
DEBUG=True
ELASTICSEARCH_DSL={
    'default': {
        'hosts': 'localhost:9200'
    }
}
```

### Elasticsearch Configuration

Update `settings.py` with the appropriate Elasticsearch configurations:

```python
ELASTICSEARCH_DSL = {
    'default': {
        'hosts': 'localhost:9200'
